## ⭐ Features
The goal of Mapty is to record your workout. By selecting location on the map, an input form will be rendered in the sidebar, on the left. Proceed to fill in workout details and a map marker will be generated accordingly. You can record workouts for different locations. Selecting workout in the sidebar will point you to the location on the map. This application allows you to record your running and cycling activities.

### IMPORTANT
This application stores data in browser's local storage. In the console, execute "app.reset()" to restore local storage to a clean state.

## 💡 Future considerations
👉 Ability to edit a workout<br/>
👉 Ability to delete a workout<br/>
👉 Ability to delete all workouts<br/>
👉 Ability to sort workouts by certain field (e.g. distance)<br/>
👉 Ability to position the map to show all workouts<br/>
👉 Ability to draw lines and shapes instead of just points<br/>
👉 Geocode location from coordinates<br/>
👉 Display weather data for workout time and place
